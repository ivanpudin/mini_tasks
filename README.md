# How to set everything up

**Create separate folder**

```
git clone https://github.com/ivanpudin/mini_tasks

git branch branch_name

git checkout branch_name

docker-compose up
```

**Run the docker and do your work**

**Everything can be found at localhost:7000**

then git add, commit, push from a branch that you are working on

after pushing we will merge code online inside github

## When you start your work be sure to work with up to date code

```
git config pull.rebase false
git pull
```
