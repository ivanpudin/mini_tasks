# How to set everything up

**Create separate folder**

```
git clone https://github.com/ivanpudin/mini_tasks

git checkout branch_name

docker-compose up
```

# How to work

Run the docker and do your work

Everything can be found at **localhost:7001**

After you are done: git add, commit, push from a branch that you are working on

# git pull

When you start, be sure to work with up to date code

git pull
```
